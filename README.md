# The-Room-Party-Problem
Our project is about a simulation addressing the Room Party Problem. It is from the book The Little Book of Semaphores by Allen B. Downey and Version 2.2.1.
Here is a table of content that we will follow. 
Before we delve into the technical aspects, let's set the stage with a bit of background. Our project revolves around a real-world incident that sparked controversy at Colby College. There were an allegation of room searches by the Dean of Students Office, leading to a campus-wide debate. 
This controversy motivated Allen B. Downey to explore the dynamics of such situations so he creates a simulation known as the Room Party Problem. This scenario was a playful response from him, as he had a personal connection with the Dean of Student Housing. 
Our simulation aims to address synchronization challenges by simulating interactions between students and the Dean within a room environment. The learning goals include providing a practical demonstration of synchronization mechanisms in concurrent systems, with relevance to real-world scenarios where coordination is essential.
